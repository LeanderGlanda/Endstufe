The code was put into the pico-sdk examples as an additional build target. It was mainly used for testing the hardware, so don't expect much functionallity. But it should configure PCM1865 correctly for input 1, PCM9122 for passing through the signal from PCM1865 and using the frist PCM5122 correctly as simple DAC. Amplifier ICs are wired wrong (SDZ and MUTEZ are connected), so the code doesn't configure them correctly. This is also why version 1 failed.
